        "text": "I'm Chris -- the reason I made this guide is because a lot of people would reach out to me asking common questions, so I put this website together as a way to answer all those common questions, document everything I've learned over the years, things I wish I knew when I was a first year student, and more. I was inspired when I saw students from other universities making guides like this, so I wanted to do the same. If there's any concerns you have about the content on this guide, want a topic added, or want to contribute, then feel free to message me on Discord, @chrispy#8933. There's always so much information I want to share that I barely have time to write and update this website, so feel free to shoot me a message if you have a question about anything."
