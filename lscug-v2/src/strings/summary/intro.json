        "text": "I feel like sharing my university career will be beneficial because I did not have a very conventional path. I decided midway through my degree that I wanted to drop from the honours program, I took about 20 months off of school to do five internship back to back to back to back to back, and overall it was just...different than how most people do university. I just want to show whoever is reading this that you don't have to approach university how you 'think' it should be done -- things changes, everyone's situation is unique, and more. For context, I graduated from high school June 2017 and had no idea what I wanted to study in university. I knew that I was expected to go to university by my family (and I guess it's just the 'assumption' or 'generic' route people take after graduating high school) and I originally thought about majoring in chemistry since it's what I excelled at in high school. My high school didn't offer computer science courses at the time so I never even really got to explore if computer science was my thing or not. I applied to chemistry, but on a whim I decided to apply to computer science, I have no idea why I did, I literally just did it. No divine relevation or anything, but my gut feeling just told me apply. I got accepted into computer science, never wrote a single line of code before, had no idea what it was about, but I just felt like it was right for me so I accepted my offer to study computer science at York University, and started September 2017. So, here's basically the last four years of my life. Note, this will be really long."
