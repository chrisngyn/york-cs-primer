## Contributing
Thank you for contributing to the project! While I can't guarantee your PR will
be merged, I'm open to reviewing any changes that might improve the website. :rocket:

### What can I work on?
Most things I need help for (i.e. course descriptions) will be posted in the
[issues board](https://github.com/chrisngyn/LCSUG/issues). If there's something
you think is worth adding and it's not on the board, open an issue for it!

### First time setup
- Ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your machine
- Fork this project to your GitHub account
- Clone your forked copy to your machine: `git clone https://github.com/{YOUR_USER}/york-cs-primer.git`
- To setup the project, `npm install` then `npm start`
- Make your changes, commit to your branch, and open a PR: `https://github.com/chrisngyn/york-cs-primer/compare`
- After merging to main, I run `npm run deploy` and it'll update the website!
