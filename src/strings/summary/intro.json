        "text": "I feel that sharing my university career will be beneficial because I did not have a very conventional path. I decided midway through my degree that I wanted to drop from the honours program, I took ~20 total months away from school to do five internship, and overall it was just...different than how most people do university. \n\n I want to show whoever is reading this that you don't have to approach university how you 'think' it should be done: things changes, everyone's circumstance is unique, and you should do what's best for you. \n\n For context, I graduated from high school in June 2017 and had no idea what I wanted to study in university. I knew that I was expected to go to university by my family (and I guess it's just the generic 'route' people take after graduating high school) and I originally thought about majoring in chemistry since it's what I excelled at in high school. My high school didn't offer computer science courses at the time so I never even got to explore if computer science was for me or not. I applied to chemistry, but on a whim I decided to apply to computer science as well. No divine revelation or anything, but my gut feeling was saying to do it (you also get to apply to up to three programs for free anyways). I got accepted into computer science, never wrote a single line of code before, had no idea what it entailed, but I felt like it was right for me so I accepted my offer to study computer science at York University, and started in September 2017. \n\n So, here's basically the last 4-5 years of my life. Warning, this is going to be really long."
