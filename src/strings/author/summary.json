I went to the Lassonde academic advisors to ask for advice and the person I talked to suggested that I drop out of computer science, and that chemistry was better for me since I had an A in CHEM1000. I almost did, but I stayed in out of spite. I ended this semester with a D+, C, dropped, dropped, and B+."

When summer came I decided to stop moping about it and get my life together, so I took bought a Udemy Python course so I could learn how to code, spent the summer writing a few personal projects and putting them on my GitHub, and I retook three courses this summer (EECS1019, EECS2011, MATH1300). I also took HUMA2200, public speaking, which ended up being my favourite course and one that taught me a lot about how to build rapport with people. I turned 2 Ds and a C into 2 As and a B+ that summer, and got an A in HUMA2200. I made a lot of new friends in my summer courses, worked a part time student IT job where I made even more friends, and overall it was an awesome and productive summer where I grew and matured a lot. I raised my GPA from a 4.6 to a 6.1, which was just barely enough to admit me into the Lassonde internship program (needed a 6.0 minimum)."

Relatively light courseload, but trying to juggle applying to internships, LeetCode, and making side projects - it was really overwhelming. Navigating recruitment season is so hard, especially if you're inexperienced. I sent ~200 applications and heard nothing back. All the jobs I applied to was doing nothing for me. I was applying viciously all of January, February, and March...and it wasn't until the end of March I got an email from CaseWare asking me to take their OA. I took the OA, passed, and got invited to an interview. I was scared and praying - after I took the interview, I got an email saying I got the job! I was going to be a software engineer intern that summer! All that blood, sweat, and tears was worth it. I was able to focus on school for the rest of the semester and ended with a B+, A, pass, and B+. This was also the term when the COVID-19 pandemic started picking up. Around April, school and exams went remote. It was a pretty nice break, and made for easy exams."

You know why this was especially shitty? I got the email they were rescinding my offer two weeks before I was supposed to begin, giving me no time to find another internship, and I actually declined interviews at other companies because I had already signed an offer at CaseWare. Things were looking pretty grim, but there was this program I saw advertised around called the MLH Fellowship by Major League Hacking. It was an internship where you work on open source software, and it was oriented towards students who lost their job because of the COVID-19 pandemic. I applied, got an interview, passed it, and I got this internship miraculously last minute. In the middle of this internship, CaseWare reached out to me asking if I wanted to intern with them during the fall, and I said okay. I signed an 8 month contract, so I'd be with them the upcoming fall and winter semesters. Things ended up okay, but I'll never forget that first week when I found out the news, I was so depressed."

I was on a frontend team and I hate frontend, so I wasn't particularly enjoying my time working. While interning here I kept applying to more internships, and I got a job at MDA Space for the winter semester...so I told CaseWare I'd be breaking my contract and leaving the company early. They were okay with it and they understood, but Lassonde was upset with me, saying I was unprofessional and ruining the school's reputation with the company. Call me selfish, but I didn't really care. I was just looking out for myself and what was best for me."

Though, I wasn't content with CaseWare and MDA Space on my resume, since I wanted bigger names. Back in November I got an Amazon OA and I wanted it bad. I did 5-6 hours of LeetCode a day, followed a bunch of CS subreddits, connected with a bunch of people and joined many online communities. This was the point in time I found the 'CS Majors' and 'cscareers.dev' Discord servers, the staples of any CS student. It did affect my performance at work since I was doing LeetCode everyday because I had the Amazon interview in February. I took the interview and passed, so now I was en route to working at Amazon in the summer! Around March, I got an interview with Shopify, and I ended up getting the job offer as well for the summer...but I already signed an offer with Amazon. Not wanting to pass up the opportunity, I asked if the offer could be moved to the fall semester, and they said yes. Now I was also en route to working at Shopify in the fall - this would be my 5th internship in a row."

I met a bunch of other interns (not just from Amazon, but also LinkedIn and Microsoft) and had a really good time. We went to the beach and went drinking every other day, so it made me really sad I didn't choose to work hybrid, since Amazon gave the option of that or to work fully remote. After taking that trip to Vancouver, I wish I worked there instead."

I already decided I'd drop from the 4 year honours program to the 3 year program, so I've effectively taking 5 years now and I still don't have my degree for what's supposed to be a 3 year program. I took too many internships, but with each recruiting season I went through I ended up learning a lot, making new connections, and expanding my network. I worked at Shopify this term and had a good time. At this point, I was 78.0 / 90.0 credits done for my degree, so I just needed 4 more courses until I graduate. I did end up applying to jobs again during my Shopify term, but this time to both new grad and internship roles. The idea was that I'd apply to new grad roles at some companies, but others I'd apply to internship roles, because new grad interviews were much harder and I could 'game' the system a bit. See, a new grad interview cycle at Facebook is 5 stages and an intern interview cycle is 2 stages. So, if you want to new grad at Facebook, you can intern there first, and get a new grad return offer, and skip over new grad interviews if you don't feel confident in your skills to pass them. Speaking of Facebook, I applied and got an offer to intern there next summer, woohoo!"

I formally graduated from York University's computer science program in October 2022 with a regular, non-honours, Bachelors of Science degree. \n\n I ended up accepting a winter internship with Square since the pay was good and it gave me something to do during the winter term, and I signed a new grad offer to work for Ramp in New York City full-time, starting May 2023."
