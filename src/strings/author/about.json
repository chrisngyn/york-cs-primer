        "text": "Hey, I'm Christopher. This website is my love letter and graduation gift to York University. \n\n The reason I made this guide was because many people would reach out to me asking common questions, so I put this website together as a way to hand down all the knowledge I've accumulated over the years, document everything I wish I knew when I was a first year student, and more. I was inspired when I saw students from other universities making guides like this, so I wanted to do the same. \n\n If there's any concerns you have about the content on this website, want to see a topic added, or want to contribute something yourself, then feel free to send me a message. \n\n I love this place (mainly due the people I've met, not the institution), and I really hope to see it become a titan of a school in the following years to come."
