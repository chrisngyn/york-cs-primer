I've linked a lot of resources, and there's even a Discord server I made you can join to meet other like-minded people. But, if for whatever reason you wanted to talk to me one-on-one, we can setup a coffee chat where we can talk about whatever you want. We can do resume reviews, mock interviews, the whole shebang. \n\n I won't charge money for that kind of service because I think it's shitty to profit off of someone just looking for help, but I am asking you to donate whatever amount you want to this charity: https://www.bluedragon.org/donate > Vietnam. \n\n Feel free to email me @ christopher.nguyn@gmail.com, granted I might not reply quickly, sometimes not at all if it's a low effort email."
