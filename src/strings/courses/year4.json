        "text": "Note: if you're deciding to NOT do your honours, you don't have to take ANY fourth year EECS courses. There are no mandatory 4XXX level EECS courses. When you get to this point, you take the courses that interest you the most, fulfill the requirements of your degree, and graduate. \n\n You have to take a minimum of 12.0 credit EECS4XXX level courses, but you can take as many as you want. This is one of the biggest selling points why people will drop out of the honours and graduate with the regular degree - you get to graduate one year sooner. In my personal opinion, the only reason you should stay in the honours is if you aren't entirely sure what you want to do when you graduate, and can take more courses to explore your interests. There are some genuinely interesting courses in the 4XXX level I wish I got to take, but missed out on."

My general point of view on electives is to take them as needed, don't overwhelm yourself, core courses come first, and electives later. An elective should never be so overwhelming that your grades in the main courses suffer."
