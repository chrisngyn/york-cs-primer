        "text": "There are a lot of other requirements that are sprinkled into getting the degree that occasionally get overlooked. For example, if you're in the honours you need 12.0 credits at the EECS4XXX level. You need 42.0 credits at the 3XXX level or higher. You need 30.0 credits outside of computer science and mathematics. You need 24.0 credits in the science disciplines. There are a lot, so make sure you keep checking your academic calendar, degree progress report, and check-in with guidance counsellors regularly to make sure you're hitting all the requirements."
