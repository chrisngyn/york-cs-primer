        "text": "Theory intensive course, including topics like automata theory, Turing machines, formal languages, and more. If you don't know what any of that means, I don't either still. Extremely theory heavy, very abstract at times, and hard to follow. Choose a good professor. \n\n Difficulty 8 / 10."

        "title": "EECS2011 - Fundamentals of Data Structures",
        "text": "One of the most important courses in second year alongside EECS2030. It's important to master data structures because these concepts, alongside algorithms, is what you're tested on in programming interviews (and I can attest they're concepts actually used somewhat frequently in real programming work). \n\n I was carefree the first time I took this course and got a D, but I retook it in the following summer where I got an A. Easy beginning, but when you touch trees and graphs is when it starts to get really hard. Take this course very seriously! \n\n Difficulty 7.5 / 10."

        "title": "EECS2021 - Computer Organization",
        "text": "Definitely an annoying course. You'll be learning really low level fundamentals like how computers operate and use assembly languages like RISC-V and Verilog. I've never used RISC-V or Verilog once since I finished the course, so I wouldn't invest too much time in actually mastering these languages (unless you enjoy computer / electrical engineering work, then these languages will definitely be useful). \n\n I genuinely did find the course interesting at times, but it also had a really heavy workload. The labs can take a really long time to do, and the textbook is practically necessary for this course. \n\n Difficulty 7 / 10 (largely due to how much work there is, not actually the course content itself)."

        "title": "EECS2030 - Advanced Object Oriented Programming",
        "text": "One of the most important courses in second year alongside EECS2011. This is a Java course that goes into depth about object oriented programming, an extremely important programming paradigm which you should learn very well. I enjoyed this course a lot, and has a relatively lighter courseload compared to other second year courses. \n\n Difficulty 3 / 10, though I still suggest putting a lot of time because it's arguably a top 5 course in the entire degree."

    {
        "title": "EECS2031 - Software Tools",
        "text": "Your first C course. I found this course to be challenging because I've only used Java and Python, so picking up C was hard due to it's low level nature. \n\n You'll also be learning Linux commands, Bash scripting, and more. These tools are actually important! In almost every company I worked for, I was using a Linux OS. Navigating your way through a Linux environment and terminal is important to master. Have you been using Windows or Mac the entire time? Are you used to hitting 'run' in your IDEs to execute code? Now you'll be getting into the nitty gritty and learning how to use a terminal and execute commands from there. \n\n Difficulty 6 / 10."

        "text": "Follow-up to EECS1019. I found this course to be much easier than EECS1019. It's still a lot of logic, but much less mathematical and formal. Some chapters can be abstract. \n\n Difficulty 5 / 10."

        "title": "MATH2030 - Elementary Probability",
        "text": "Note: if you're deciding to NOT do your honours (as in, you're opting to do the 90.0 credit degree over the 120.0 credit degree), you don't have to take this course! \n\n I won't be taking this course since I've opted to do the 90.0 credit program, so I don't have a good description of this course. From my friends who have taken this course, they all say it's hard. Probability, math, calculus, and proofs. \n\n Difficulty 8 / 10."
