        "text": "Graduating without work experience is a death sentence. It's hard, no one will hire you, we're in an oversaturated field, and you need a way to stand out. Get relevant experience in your undergrad so that when you graduate you have an easier time looking for jobs. Also, you'll be a better student and developer overall. \n\n I learned MUCH more in my software engineering internship than I ever did in my entire degree. To me, I hate academia. I want to graduate and get out of here. I taught myself more than my lectures did, and my internships taught me and gave me more experience than I could ask for. \n\n You can also make a lot of money working at large tech companies as an intern. My internships, in order, have paid me $27 (CaseWare) > $24 (MDA Space) > $60 (Amazon) > $40 (Shopify) > $80 (Facebook). This isn't even an upper ceiling - there are incredible internships at Jane Street, Citadel, or Hudson River Trading that'll easily do over $100 an hour."

        "text": "The truth is that your first job search is always going to be the hardest. It's when you're more inexperienced and you're just looking for a company to take a chance on you. Once you get your first work experience down, you can use that momentum to strengthen your resume and get your 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. \n\n So, how can you go about getting your first internship? Have a strong resume, have a lot of public work people can view (eg. LinkedIn, personal projects on your GitHub, or even a portfolio website you made), and apply early, and apply to many! It helps if you know people working at companies so you can get referrals - going back to my point about making friends. I've had so many friends refer me to companies, it was great. \n\n One thing that might help your first job search is to be part of the Lassonde co-op program. Companies receive a tax break when they hire interns, so some companies will actually only hire interns that are part of an accredited co-op program. Some of these companies include CIBC, RBC, CaseWare, etc. - but when you get to a point in time of targetting larger companies like Amazon / Facebook, they don't care about the tax break. They're rich as fuck. I was in the Lassonde co-op program for my first internship, then I left the program and pursued bigger names on my own."

        "title": "How do I find jobs, where do I apply?",
        "text": "A mistake students make in their job search is thinking they're limited to the Lassonde job portal (which is not substantial whatsoever) or only searching 'Software Engineer Intern' on LinkedIn. There's two important components for job searching: when do you search, and how. For SUMMER internships, postings can open as early as July / August the prior year. For FALL internships, postings will open around March / April, and for WINTER internships, postings will be open around September / October. \n\n Summer is a very busy season - a lot of companies hire for summer only and have the most headcount. Fall and winter internships are generally what I call 'dead seasons'. It's possible to get internships for fall and winter, just much harder. The way I apply to jobs is I keep a long list of 100-200 tech companies, and around when internship season begins, I'll Google search '{company name} careers', go to their careers page, and apply on the company website. \n\n Most companies won't be shelling out money to post ads on LinkedIn as they know most people will go to their website to apply (and people do). Depending on the season you're looking for, Google '{season} internships GitHub repo' - there's usually a GitHub repo floating around every season that's updated as internship applications open up. Talk in friend groups as well. If you have a group of friends and you're all collectively trying to find internships together, make a group chat and discuss. Your friends might have applied to a posting you missed, and vice versa."

        "title": "What I'm not ready to apply to jobs yet?",
        "text": "Honestly, suck it up. It takes ~15 seconds to apply to a job posting. Even if your resume / portfolio isn't ready, I always encourage applying just for practise and to get into the swing of recruiting cycles. If you do manage to get a few OAs or interviews, that's just free practise even if you think you won't pass. Who knows, maybe you can surprise yourself with an offer as well. \n\n The point is - who cares if you think you're 'not ready', it costs nothing to apply, it's practise, and you'll never be ready with that attitude. Stop kneecapping yourself and start applying to internships."
