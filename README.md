## The York University Computer Science Primer

### About
This is my take on a guide to York University's Computer Science program. This is
intended to document all the things I've learned over the years, answers to commonly
asked questions, and things I wish I knew when I was a first year student.

### Contributing
Refer to CONTRIBUTING.md. Essentially, I'll be posting GitHub issues overtime about
things I want added (e.g. missing course descriptions, UI updates, etc.) and those
are free to work on. If there's something not listed that you want to see added,
make an issue or message me on Discord **@chrispy#8933**.
