## The York University Computer Science Primer

### About
This is my take on a guide to York University's Computer Science program. This is
intended to document all the things I've learned over the years, answers to commonly
asked questions, and bequeath all the things I wish I knew sooner.

### Contributing
Refer to CONTRIBUTING.md. Essentially, I'll be posting GitHub issues overtime about
things I want added (e.g. missing course descriptions, UI updates, etc.) and those
are free to work on. If there's something not listed that you want to see added,
open an issue.
